# Quality Control  : Filter Cells bases on technical parameters

Seurat object initialization step above only considered cells that expressed at least 200 genes. 
Additionally, we would like to exclude cells that are damaged. 
A common metric to judge this (although by no means the only one) is the relative expression 
of mitochondrially derived genes. When the cells apoptose due to stress, their mitochondria becomes 
leaky and there is widespread RNA degradation. Thus a relative enrichment of mitochondrially 
derived genes can be a tell-tale sign of cell stress. Here, we compute the proportion of transcripts 
that are of mitochondrial origin for every cell (percent.mito), and visualize its distribution as a
violin plot

```{r}
# The number of genes and UMIs (nGene and nUMI) are automatically calculated
# for every object by Seurat.We calculate the percentage of
# mitochondrial genes here and store it in percent.mito using AddMetaData.
# We use object@raw.data since this represents non-transformed and
# non-log-normalized counts The % of UMI mapping to MT-genes is a common
# scRNA-seq QC metric.
mito.genes <- grep(pattern = "^MT-", x = rownames(x = pbmc@data), value = TRUE)
mito.genes %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()

percent.mito <- Matrix::colSums(pbmc@raw.data[mito.genes, ])/Matrix::colSums(pbmc@raw.data)
# AddMetaData adds columns to object@meta.data, and is a great place to
# stash QC stats
pbmc <- AddMetaData(object = pbmc, metadata = percent.mito, col.name = "percent.mito")
head(pbmc@meta.data)
nrow(pbmc@meta.data)## No. of Cells

VlnPlot(object = pbmc, features.plot = c("nGene", "nUMI", "percent.mito"), nCol = 3)

# GenePlot is typically used to visualize gene-gene relationships, but can
# be used for anything calculated by the object, i.e. columns in
# object@meta.data, PC scores etc.  Since there is a rare subset of cells
# with an outlier level of high mitochondrial percentage and also low UMI
# content, we filter these as well

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
GenePlot(object = pbmc, gene1 = "nUMI", gene2 = "percent.mito")
GenePlot(object = pbmc, gene1 = "nUMI", gene2 = "nGene")

# Load the the list of house keeping genes
hkgenes <- read.table("housekeeping_genes.txt")
hkgenes <- as.vector(hkgenes$V1) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()


# remove hkgenes that were not found
hkgenes.found <- which(toupper(rownames(pbmc@data)) %in% hkgenes)
n.expressed.hkgenes <- Matrix::colSums(pbmc@data[hkgenes.found, ] > 0)
pbmc <- AddMetaData(object = pbmc, metadata = n.expressed.hkgenes, col.name = "n.exp.hkgenes")
VlnPlot(object = pbmc, features.plot = c("nGene", "nUMI", "percent.mito","n.exp.hkgenes"), nCol = 4,  point.size.use = 0.1)

```

# Filter Cells  and genes
Let’s filter the cells based on the quality control metrics. 
Filter based on: 1. nGene 2. percent.mito  
Change the thresholds to what you think they should be according to the violin plots

```{r}
# We filter out cells that have unique gene counts over 2,500 or less than
# 200 Note that low.thresholds and high.thresholds are used to define a
# 'gate'.  -Inf and Inf should be used if you don't want a lower or upper
# threshold.

pbmc <- FilterCells(object = pbmc, subset.names = c("nGene", "percent.mito"), 
                    low.thresholds = c(200, -Inf), high.thresholds = c(2500, 0.05))

# Number of cells remaining 
pbmc
```

# Normalization
After removing unwanted cells from the dataset, the next step is to normalize the data. 
By default, we employ a global-scaling normalization method “LogNormalize” that normalizes 
the gene expression measurements for each cell by the total expression, multiplies this by a 
scale factor (10,000 by default), and log-transforms the result.
This is the simplest and the most intuitive


```{r}
pbmc <- NormalizeData(object = pbmc, normalization.method = "LogNormalize", 
                      scale.factor = 10000)
```


# Highly Variable Genes



```{r}
# Seurat calculates highly variable genes and focuses on these for downstream analysis. 
# FindVariableGenes calculates the average expression and dispersion for each gene, 
# places these genes into bins, and then calculates a z-score for dispersion within each bin
# The parameters here identify ~1900 variable genes

pbmc <- FindVariableGenes(object = pbmc, mean.function = ExpMean, dispersion.function = LogVMR, 
                          x.low.cutoff = 0.0125, x.high.cutoff = 3, y.cutoff = 0.5)

length(x = pbmc@var.genes)
```

# Scale Data

```{r}

# Your single cell dataset likely contains ‘uninteresting’ sources of variation. This could include not only technical noise, 
# but batch effects, or even biological sources of variation (cell cycle stage). 
# As suggested in Buettner et al, NBT, 2015, regressing these signals out of the analysis can 
# improve downstream dimensionality reduction and clustering. To mitigate the effect of these signals,
# Seurat constructs linear models to predict gene expression based on user-defined variables. 
# The scaled z-scored residuals of these models are stored in the scale.data slot, 
# and are used for dimensionality reduction and clustering.
pbmc <- ScaleData(object = pbmc, vars.to.regress = c("nUMI", "percent.mito"))


```


# PCA on the Scaled Data

```{r message =FALSE}

# but can be defined using pc.genes.

pbmc <- ProjectPCA(object = pbmc, do.print = FALSE)
# PCHeatmap allows for easy exploration of the primary sources of heterogeneity in a dataset, and can be useful when trying to decide which PCs to include for further downstream analyses. Both cells and genes are ordered according to their PCA scores. 
# Setting cells.use to a number plots the ‘extreme’ cells on both ends of the spectrum,

# Determine statistically significant principal components

```{r}
# Determining how many PCs to include downstream is therefore an important step.
# We identify ‘significant’ PCs as those who have a strong enrichment of low p-value genes.
pbmc <- JackStraw(object = pbmc, num.replicate = 100, display.progress = FALSE)
# ‘Significant’ PCs will show a strong enrichment of genes with low p-values
# (solid curve above the dashed line). In this case it appears that PCs 1-10 are significant.

```

# Cluster the cells

```{r}
# Importantly, the distance metric which drives the clustering analysis
# (based on previously identified PCs) remains the same.
# The FindClusters function implements the procedure, and contains a resolution parameter
# that sets the ‘granularity’ of the downstream clustering, with increased values leading
# to a greater number of clusters. We find that setting this parameter between
# 0.6-1.2 typically returns good results for single cell datasets of around 3K cells.
pbmc <- FindClusters(object = pbmc, reduction.type = "pca", dims.use = 1:10,

# Finding differentially expressed genes (cluster biomarkers)

# process for all clusters, but you can also test groups of clusters vs. each other,
# or against all cells.

# The min.pct argument requires a gene to be detected at a minimum percentage in 
# either of the two groups of cells, and the thresh.test argument requires a gene to be 
# differentially expressed (on average) by some amount between the two groups.
# find all markers of cluster 1
