# _**Principal Investigator**_

## Hanrui Zhang MB PhD
### Assistant Professor of Medicine 
**Email:** hz2418@cumc.columbia.edu

Dr. Hanrui Zhang is a macrophage biologist and cardiovascular physiologist. She completed her PhD training in 2011 at the University of Missouri. Her graduate work centered on the crosstalk between immune cells and blood vessels in diabetes-associated vascular diseases. Her postdoctoral research at the University of Pennsylvania continued to address the mechanisms of cardiometabolic diseases focusing on disease modeling using human iPS cell-derived macrophages and CRISPR. Her laboratory addresses the mechanisms of cardiometabolic diseases with a specific focus on the multi-dimensional role of macrophages in lipid metabolism and innate immunity using functional genomic approaches, RNA-sequencing, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, murine models, and immunological and molecular biological methods.
