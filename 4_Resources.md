We published the **[protocol](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cpsc.74)** to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) to macrophages.  iPSC-derived macrophages (IPSDM) obtained using this protocol have demonstrated excellent functional and transcriptomic fidelity relative to human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM), with advantages and successful applications in disease modeling using patients-derived and CRISPR-edited iPSC lines ([ATVB 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5659288)). Through deep RNA-sequencing, the coding transcriptome ([Circ Res 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4565503/)), alternative splicing events ([ATVB 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4919157/)) and long non-coding RNA profiles ([JAHA 2017](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.117.007431?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed)) between isogenic IPSDM and HMDM at baseline and during activation are characterized, providing a comprehensive resource for planning IPSDM studies to model such events. This protocol and the associated resources provide a unique platform to understand human macrophage-specific functional, transcriptomic and genomic features in physiology and a broad spectrum of macrophage-relevant diseases.

The RNA-seq data of isogenic IPSDM and HMDM can be visualized in the UCSC genome browser by adding track hub using URL **https://de.cyverse.org/anon-files/iplant/home/chenyix/trackhub/GENEiPS_scaled/hub.txt** or through the following **[link](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&hubUrl=https://de.cyverse.org/anon-files/iplant/home/chenyix/trackhub/GENEiPS_scaled/hub.txt)**. The original RNA-seq data are available from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number [GSE55536](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55536).
