>### _The goal of the Zhang laboratory is to elucidate the mechanisms and therapeutic implications of macrophage heterogeneity and plasticity in cardiometabolic diseases._  

Dr. Zhang's laboratory seeks to understand the dynamic role of macrophages in cardiometabolic diseases with the aim of finding new treatments. The laboratory applies technologies for high-throughput functional genomics, human iPSC and CRISPR gene editing, transgenic mouse models, human genetics, and a variety of cell and molecular techniques. 

The main areas of study in the laboratory include: (1) Functional genomics and mechanistic studies of candidate genes and genetic variants inspired by human genome-wide association studies of cardiometabolic traits; (2) Unbiased CRISPR screen in primary macrophages to discover novel regulators and pathways of macrophage efferocytosis and investigate their roles in atherosclerosis; (3) The role of human macrophage long noncoding RNAs in macrophage biology. The long-term goal of my laboratory is to elucidate the mechanisms and therapeutic implications of macrophage heterogeneity and plasticity in cardiometabolic diseases.
