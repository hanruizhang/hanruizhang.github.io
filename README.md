### Academic appointments
#### Assistant Professor

Dr. Hanrui Zhang is a macrophage biologist and cardiovascular physiologist. Her research addresses the mechanisms of cardiometabolic diseases with a specific focus on the multi-dimensional role of macrophages in lipid metabolism and innate immunity using functional genomic approaches, RNA-sequencing, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, murine models, and immunological and molecular biological methods. The long-term goal of the Zhang laboratory is to elucidate the mechanisms and therapeutic implications of macrophage heterogeneity and plasticity in cardiometabolic diseases. 

Dr. Zhang is a member of the Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology (ATVB) Women's Leadership Committee (WLC). It is her mission and passion to support the career advancement of the next generation of translational scientists. Potential students, postdoctoral trainees and visiting scientists are encouraged to contact Dr. Zhang at hz2418@cumc.columbia.edu for opportunities to work in the laboratory.

### Research

The Zhang laboratory in the Department of Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center is interested in the role of macrophages in cardiometabolic diseases. The main areas of study in the Zhang laboratory include: (1) Functional interpretation of candidate genes and genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies of cardiometabolic traits; (2) Unbiased CRISPR screen in primary macrophages to discover novel regulators of macrophage efferocytosis; (3) The role of human macrophage long noncoding RNAs in macrophage biology.
