>### _The goal of the Zhang laboratory is to elucidate the mechanisms and therapeutic implications of macrophage heterogeneity and plasticity in cardiometabolic diseases._  

Dr. Zhang's laboratory investigates the role of macrophages in cardiometabolic diseases using human monocyte- and iPSC-derived macrophages, murine models, CRISPR gene editing and genome-wide screening, and functional genomics technologies.  

The main areas of study in the laboratory include: (1) Functional validation of candidate genes and genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies of cardiometabolic traits; (2) Unbiased CRISPR screen in primary macrophages to discover novel regulators of macrophage efferocytosis; (3) The role of human macrophage long noncoding RNAs in macrophage biology.
